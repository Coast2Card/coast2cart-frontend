# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome to the project! ðŸŽ‰  
This document explains how we work together. Please read it carefully before contributing.

## ðŸ“Œ Branching Strategy

- **`main`** is our protected branch. No one pushes directly to `main`.
- All work must be done on **feature branches**:
  - `<your-name>/feature/<feature-name>` â†’ new features (e.g., `neo/feature/login-page`)
  - `<your-name>/bugfix/<bug-name>` â†’ bug fixes (e.g., `neo/bugfix/cart-total`)
  - `<your-name>/hotfix/<hotfix-name>` â†’ urgent fixes to `main` (e.g., `neo/hotfix/payment-error`)
