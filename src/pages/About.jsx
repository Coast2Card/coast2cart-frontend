          Barangay Baybayon is a coastal community where fishing, dried seafood,
          and small-scale tourism have long been the livelihood of families.
          With a population of over 2,000, many households rely on the sea for
          their daily income, catching fresh fish and crafting souvenirs that
          reflect the culture and spirit of the barangay.

            Fishing is at the heart of Baybayon. Most families rely on the sea
            for their income, catching fresh fish that is enjoyed not only
            within the barangay but also in nearby towns. The work begins before
            sunrise and often depends on weather and season, making every catch
            valuable. Freshness and quality are the pride of Baybayon's
            fishermen, who continue to pass down this tradition from one
            generation to the next.

            lifestyle. These handmade pieces can be brought home by visitors as
            a memory of the barangay. Together with dried seafood products,
            these crafts provide residents with an extra source of income and
